# Critical Fixes Needed - 88.2% FAILURE RATE

## Executive Summary
The sales agent has an 88.2% failure rate (15/17 scenarios failed). The "all" response fix was NOT implemented. Core issues remain unfixed.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE #1: No Conversation Context in extractLeadInfo

**Current Code (BROKEN):**
```javascript
const prompt = `Analyze this customer message and extract any information provided:
Message: "${message}"
```

**The tool only sees the single message!** It has NO IDEA what was asked before.

**Required Fix:**
```javascript
// Get last 3 messages for context
const conversationContext = state.messages.slice(-3).map(m => 
  `${m.type}: ${m.content}`
).join('\n');

const prompt = `Analyze this customer message IN CONTEXT of the conversation:

Conversation context:
${conversationContext}

Current message to analyze: "${message}"

If user says "all", "todo", "si", "yes" - look at what was asked in the previous message!
```

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE #2: Calendar Not Showing

Even with all fields populated, the calendar tool is not being called. The agent logic needs to check after EVERY extraction if all fields are complete and trigger calendar display.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE #3: Budget Confirmation Not Working

When bot asks "Â¿Tu presupuesto mensual es de $500?" and user says "si", the tool doesn't extract budget:500 because it has no context that a question was asked.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE #4: Missing State Access

The extractLeadInfo tool tries to access state but the config structure might be wrong:
```javascript
const graphState = config?.getState ? await config.getState() : null;
```

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Pass conversation context to extractLeadInfo**
   - Include last 3 messages
   - Explain to LLM what questions were asked
   - Handle contextual responses

2. **Fix state access in tools**
   - Ensure proper config structure
   - Access messages from state

3. **Auto-trigger calendar when qualified**
   - Check after each extraction
   - If all fields present + budget >= $300, show calendar

4. **Handle confirmations properly**
   - "si" after budget question = extract budget
   - "all" after multi-question = extract all mentioned fields

## Test Command
```bash
./run-100-test.sh
```

## Expected Success Rate After Fixes
- Current: 11.8%
- Target: 95%+

## Files to Fix
1. `/agents/salesAgent.js` - extractLeadInfo tool (lines 105-335)
2. Agent logic to auto-trigger calendar
3. State management configuration

The bot is essentially "deaf" to context. It's like having a conversation with someone who forgets everything after each sentence!
