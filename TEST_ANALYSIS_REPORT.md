## Only 2 Scenarios Passed ✅

1. **Spanglish Mix** - Successfully extracted name "Mike"
2. **Question During Qualification** - Unknown why this passed

## Root Causes

1. **Success Criteria Too Strict**: Expecting exact phrases that bot doesn't use
2. **Missing Tool Calls**: Calendar and booking tools not being invoked
3. **Context Not Passed**: extractLeadInfo still not getting conversation context
4. **State Management Issues**: Fields extracted but not triggering next steps

## Recommendations

1. **Fix extractLeadInfo Tool**:
   - Pass last 3 messages for context
   - Handle "all", "si", "yes" responses
   - Understand confirmations

2. **Fix Bot Introduction**:
   - Ensure bot always says "Soy María"
   - Ask for name after greeting

3. **Fix Calendar Flow**:
   - Trigger calendar when all fields present
   - Ensure email triggers calendar display

4. **Fix Appointment Booking**:
   - Implement parseTimeSelection properly
   - Set appointmentBooked flag

5. **Adjust Test Criteria**:
   - Make message matching more flexible
   - Check for intent not exact words

## Next Steps

1. Review and fix extractLeadInfo implementation
2. Ensure proper conversation flow logic
3. Verify all tools are being called correctly
4. Re-run tests after fixes

The "all" fix that was supposedly applied is NOT working. The core issues remain.
