# Production Fix Summary - Outlet Media Bot

## Issue Identified
The production webhook is failing with an error message "Lo siento, hubo un error procesando tu mensaje" despite successfully:
1. Receiving webhook data
2. Fetching conversation history
3. Extracting lead information
4. Sending WhatsApp messages via GHL

## Root Cause
The sales agent is using the Command pattern (designed for StateGraph nodes) but createReactAgent expects tools to return plain values. This architectural mismatch causes an OpenAI error:
"An assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be followed by tool messages"

## Evidence
- WhatsApp messages ARE being sent successfully (confirmed via logs)
- The error occurs AFTER successful operation
- Tools execute correctly but return Command objects instead of plain values

## Temporary Fix Applied
Added error handling in both webhook handler and sales agent to catch and ignore the tool_calls error since the operation completes successfully:

```javascript
// In salesAgent.js
if (error.message && error.message.includes('tool_calls must be followed by tool messages')) {
  logger.warn('⚠️ Tool calls error after successful operation - returning current state', {
    traceId,
    error: error.message
  });
  return initialState;
}
```

## Permanent Fix Needed
1. Refactor all tools to return plain values instead of Command objects
2. Update tool implementations to match createReactAgent expectations
3. Remove the Command pattern from tool returns
4. Test thoroughly before deploying

## Files Modified
1. `/agents/salesAgent.js` - Added tool_calls error handling, disabled checkpointer
2. `/agents/webhookHandler.js` - Added tool_calls error handling

## Testing Results
- ✅ WhatsApp messages sent successfully
- ✅ Lead info extracted correctly
- ❌ Tool_calls error still thrown (but now handled gracefully)

## Deployment Instructions
1. Commit the temporary fix
2. Deploy to production
3. Monitor logs for "Tool calls error after successful operation" warnings
4. Plan refactoring of tool architecture in next sprint
