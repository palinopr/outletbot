# CRITICAL: Production Cache Not Working

## Issue
Production is using `sales_agent` graph directly, bypassing ALL caching logic. Every "hola" costs ~10K tokens ($0.05+).

## Root Cause
LangGraph deployment is configured to use:
- Graph: `sales_agent` 
- Entry point: Direct to agent (no cache check)

## Evidence from Latest Trace
```
Input: "hola"
Processing: 
  1. extract_lead_info (AI call)
  2. send_ghl_message (AI call)
Tokens: 9,611 (should be 0)
Cost: ~$0.05 per greeting
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Change Graph in Production (RECOMMENDED)
In LangGraph deployment settings, change:
```
FROM: sales_agent
TO: webhook_handler
```

The webhook_handler includes cache logic BEFORE calling sales agent.

### Option 2: Deploy Latest Code
The latest commit adds cache directly to sales agent:
```javascript
// In salesAgent.js
if (cachedResponse) {
  return { messages: [...], cached: true };
}
```

### Option 3: Configure Graph Routing
Create a router graph that checks cache first:
```javascript
// langgraph.json
"graphs": {
  "main": "./agents/router.js",  // New entry point
  "sales_agent": "./agents/salesAgent.js",
  "webhook_handler": "./agents/webhookHandler.js"
}
```

## Immediate Actions

1. **Check LangGraph Platform Settings**
   - Which graph is set as entry point?
   - Can we change it to webhook_handler?

2. **Verify Latest Deploy**
   - Has commit c3d54ee been deployed?
   - Check if salesAgent.js has cache logic

3. **Test in LangGraph Studio**
   - Send "hola" 
   - Check if cached: true
   - Verify token usage = 0

## Cost Impact
- Current: $0.05 per "hola"
- With cache: $0.00 per "hola"
- Daily savings: ~$50+ (1000 greetings/day)

## Verification
After fix, trace should show:
```
Input: "hola"
Processing: CACHED RESPONSE
Tokens: 0
cached: true
```
