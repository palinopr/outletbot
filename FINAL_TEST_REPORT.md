## Critical Fixes Summary

### 1. Field Extraction Fix
**Problem**: LLM returning capitalized field names causing extraction failure
**Solution**: Updated prompt to explicitly request lowercase field names
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

### 2. Recursion Protection
**Problem**: Infinite loops when extraction failed
**Solution**: MAX_EXTRACTION_ATTEMPTS limit + message deduplication
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

### 3. State Management
**Problem**: Global variables causing concurrent user conflicts
**Solution**: Conversation-scoped state with Annotation.Root
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

### 4. Tool Consistency
**Problem**: Inconsistent tool returns
**Solution**: All tools return Command objects
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

### 5. Conversation Termination
**Problem**: Conversations continuing after booking
**Solution**: bookAppointment returns `goto: "END"`
**Status**: ✅ VERIFIED

## Performance Improvements
