# Live Testing Report - LangGraph Modern Patterns Implementation

## Testing Date: January 26, 2025

## Summary of Testing Attempts

### 1. LangGraph Platform Server Testing

**Attempted**: Running local LangGraph server using `npx @langchain/langgraph-cli@latest dev`

**Results**:
- ‚úÖ Server started successfully on port 2024
- ‚ùå Schema extraction errors for both graphs (sales_agent and webhook_handler)
- ‚ùå TypeScript parsing issues with the new patterns
- üîÑ Server is running but unable to properly parse the modern patterns

**Error Details**:
```
Error: Failed to extract schema for "sales_agent"
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'flags')
```

### 2. Direct Agent Testing

**Attempted**: Direct invocation of the salesAgent with mock services

**Results**:
- ‚ùå Hit recursion limit (10) without reaching stop condition
- üîç This indicates the agent is looping infinitely
- üí° The issue is likely due to the mismatch between Command objects and createReactAgent

## Key Findings

### The Core Issue

The implementation has been updated to use the latest patterns from the official LangGraph documentation:
- ‚úÖ Annotation.Root for state management
- ‚úÖ Command objects for tool returns
- ‚úÖ Dynamic prompt functions
- ‚úÖ preModelHook for message windowing

However, there's a **critical compatibility issue**:

**createReactAgent** in the current version expects tools to return simple objects that get merged into state, not Command objects. The Command pattern is used with custom graphs built using StateGraph, not with the prebuilt createReactAgent.

## Testing Environments Available

### 1. **Local Development Server** (Partially Working)
```bash
npx @langchain/langgraph-cli@latest dev
```
- Server runs at http://localhost:2024
- Studio UI at https://smith.langchain.com/studio?baseUrl=http://localhost:2024
- Schema extraction issues prevent full functionality

### 2. **LangGraph Cloud** (Recommended)
- Deploy to LangGraph Cloud for full platform support
- Would require fixing the pattern mismatch first

### 3. **Self-Hosted Options**
- Self-Hosted Lite (free up to 1M nodes)
- Requires Docker, Redis, and Postgres setup

## Recommendations for Live Testing

### Option 1: Fix Pattern Mismatch (Recommended)

The code needs to be adjusted to either:

**A) Use StateGraph directly** (to support Command objects):
```javascript
const workflow = new StateGraph(AgentStateAnnotation);
workflow.addNode("agent", agentNode);
workflow.addNode("tools", toolNode);
// Add edges and compile
```

**B) Revert tools to simple returns** (for createReactAgent):
```javascript
// Instead of: return new Command({ update: {...} })
return { leadInfo: merged, extractionCount: count + 1 };
```

### Option 2: Use LangGraph Studio for Debugging

Despite the schema errors, you can still:
1. Access Studio UI at the provided URL
2. Use the visual debugger to see where the recursion occurs
3. Monitor state transitions in real-time

### Option 3: Create Integration Tests

Create tests that work with the current implementation:
```javascript
// Test with proper graph structure
const graph = new StateGraph(AgentStateAnnotation);
// Build custom graph with Command support
```

## Current Status

- **Code Update**: ‚úÖ Successfully migrated to modern patterns
- **Local Testing**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially working (server runs but with errors)
- **Pattern Compatibility**: ‚ùå Mismatch between Command objects and createReactAgent
- **Documentation**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive migration guide created

## Next Steps for Full Testing

1. **Decide on Architecture**:
   - Keep createReactAgent with simple returns
   - OR migrate to full StateGraph implementation

2. **Fix Implementation**:
   - Adjust based on chosen architecture
   - Ensure pattern consistency

3. **Deploy for Testing**:
   - Local server with fixed patterns
   - OR deploy to LangGraph Cloud
   - OR use Self-Hosted Lite with Docker

- **LangGraph Cloud**: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/cloud/
- **Studio Documentation**: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/concepts/studio/

The implementation has been updated with the latest patterns, but needs architectural alignment for proper testing in a live environment.
