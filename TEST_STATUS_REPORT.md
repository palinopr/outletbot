## Critical Finding

The extractLeadInfo tool has NOT been updated with conversation context. The prompt still only analyzes the single message without any context:

```javascript
const prompt = `Analyze this customer message and extract any information provided:
Message: "${message}"
```

## What Needs to Be Fixed

1. **extractLeadInfo must get conversation context**
2. **Calendar must auto-trigger when all fields present**
3. **Appointment booking must work**
4. **Test success criteria may be too strict**

## Recommendation

The core fix for contextual responses ("all", "si", etc.) has NOT been implemented in the extractLeadInfo tool. Without conversation context, the bot cannot understand contextual responses.
