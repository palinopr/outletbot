# Fix for State Persistence Issue

## Problem
The tools are not accessing the current graph state properly. Each tool call seems to start with empty state, causing lead information to be lost between calls.

## Root Cause
In `createReactAgent`, tools need to access state differently than in raw StateGraph. The current implementation tries to use `config.getState()` which doesn't exist in this context.

## Solution
Tools in `createReactAgent` receive the current state through the agent's internal state management. We need to ensure:

1. Tools properly access the current state
2. State updates are properly merged
3. The agent configuration passes state correctly to tools

## Key Issue
The test shows:
- Step 1: No lead info
- Step 2: Extracts "Carlos" but then loses it
- Step 3: Extracts "restaurant" but loses name
- Each step starts fresh without previous data

This indicates the state is not being properly passed between tool calls.
