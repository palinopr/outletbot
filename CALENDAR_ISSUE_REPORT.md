# Calendar Issue Report

## Issues Found

### 1. No Calendar Slots Available
- Calendar ID: `eIHCWiTQjE1lTzjdz4xi`
- Location ID: `sHFG9Rw6BdGh6d6bfMqG`
- **Problem**: The calendar API returns 0 available slots for any date range
- **Impact**: Bot cannot show appointment times to qualified leads

### 2. Calendar Not Properly Configured
When querying the calendar details, all fields return `undefined`:
- Name: undefined
- Active: undefined  
- Slot Duration: undefined
- Availability: undefined

### 3. Bot Flow Working Correctly
The bot successfully:
- ✅ Responds to greetings (using cache)
- ✅ Extracts lead information (name, problem, goal, budget, email)
- ✅ Sends WhatsApp messages
- ✅ Qualifies leads based on budget
- ❌ Cannot show calendar slots (no slots available)

## Solution Required

1. **Configure Calendar in GHL**:
   - Log into GoHighLevel
   - Navigate to location: `sHFG9Rw6BdGh6d6bfMqG`
   - Find calendar: `eIHCWiTQjE1lTzjdz4xi`
   - Set up availability/working hours
   - Add available time slots
   - Ensure calendar is active

2. **Alternative**: Use a different calendar ID that has slots configured

## Test Results

- Cache working: ✅ (greetings respond instantly)
- Message sending: ✅ (WhatsApp messages sent successfully)
- Lead extraction: ✅ (extracts name, email, etc.)
- Calendar slots: ❌ (0 slots available)

## Code Status

The bot code is working correctly. The issue is with the GHL calendar configuration, not the code.

When calendar slots are available, the bot will:
1. Collect all required info (name, problem, goal, budget, email)
2. Show available appointment times
3. Book the appointment when user selects a time

## Next Steps

1. Configure calendar availability in GHL
2. Or provide a calendar ID that has slots already configured
3. Test again with proper calendar setup
