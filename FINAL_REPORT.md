# Final Test Report - After All Fixes Applied

## Test Results Summary

### Latest Test Run: 5.9% Success Rate (1/17 scenarios passed)

This is WORSE than before (was 11.8%). The system now has:
- ❌ Recursion limit errors
- ❌ Still no conversation context in extractLeadInfo
- ❌ Only 1 scenario passing vs 2 before

## Critical Issues Still Present

1. **No Conversation Context**: The extractLeadInfo tool still only sees single messages
2. **Recursion Limit Hit**: The agent is getting stuck in loops
3. **Calendar Not Triggering**: Even with all fields, calendar doesn't show
4. **Contextual Responses Broken**: "all", "si", "yes" still don't work

## What Actually Happened

Despite claiming "fixed all", the extractLeadInfo tool was NOT updated with conversation context. The prompt is still:

```javascript
const prompt = `Analyze this customer message and extract any information provided:
Message: "${message}"
```

There's NO conversation history being passed to understand context.

## Recursion Error

The system hit a recursion limit of 25, suggesting the agent is:
- Calling the same tools repeatedly
- Getting stuck in infinite loops
- Not properly terminating conversations

## Success Rate Over Time

1. Initial: 11.8% (2/17 passed)
2. After "fixed all": 11.8% (2/17 passed) - No change
3. Latest: 5.9% (1/17 passed) - Got WORSE

## Conclusion

The fixes were not properly applied. The core issue of missing conversation context in extractLeadInfo remains unresolved.
