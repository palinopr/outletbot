### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **Proper Tool Usage**: 
   - Agent correctly called `extract_lead_info` first
   - No information found in "hola", so proceeded to greeting
   - Used `send_ghl_message` to respond to customer

2. **Conversation Flow**:
   - Started with greeting and self-introduction
   - Asked for customer's name as first qualification step
   - Followed the expected qualification sequence

3. **State Management**:
   - Contact ID properly maintained: gz4HScg7stWbRJHqHYGW
   - Phone number normalized: +13054870475
   - Lead info initialized with name: "Jaime" (from previous conversation?)

### üîç Observations

1. **Lead Info State**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Jaime",
     "problem": null,
     "goal": null,
     "budget": null,
     "phone": "+13054870475"
   }
   ```
   - Name was already populated (likely from previous conversation)
   - Other fields are null (ready to be collected)

2. **No State Loss Issues**:
   - This trace shows the system working correctly
   - No repeated tool calls or extraction loops
   - Clean execution with proper termination

3. **Response Time**:
   - Total duration under 9 seconds is acceptable
   - Most time spent on LLM calls (expected)

### üéØ Conclusion

- ‚úÖ Proper tool execution order
- ‚úÖ Correct Spanish language response
- ‚úÖ Appropriate greeting and name request
- ‚úÖ No state management issues
