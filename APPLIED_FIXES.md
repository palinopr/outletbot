# Fixes Applied to Sales Agent

## 1. ✅ Added Conversation Context to extractLeadInfo

**Before**: Tool only saw single message
```javascript
Message: "${message}"
```

**After**: Tool now sees conversation context
```javascript
CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
${conversationContext}

CURRENT MESSAGE TO ANALYZE: "${message}"
```

### Key Improvements:
- Gets last 5 messages for context
- Understands "si" = confirmation of previous question
- Understands "500" after budget question = budget: 500
- Handles contextual responses

## 2. ✅ Updated System Prompt

Added rules to ensure:
- Bot always introduces as "Soy María"
- Auto-triggers calendar when all fields collected
- Clear qualification flow

## 3. ✅ Increased Recursion Limits

- Agent: 25 → 50
- Tests: Added 100 limit for complex scenarios

## 4. ✅ Contextual Response Rules

Added specific rules for:
- "si" after budget question → Extract budget value
- Number after budget question → Extract as budget
- "all" after multi-question → Request specific details

## Test Results Improvement

- Initial: 11.8% (2/17 passed)
- After context fix: 17.6% (3/17 passed)
- Budget extraction from numbers: ✅ Working
- "All" response: Now gets context but needs refinement

## Remaining Issues

1. **Test Criteria Too Strict**: Tests expect exact phrases
2. **"Si" Confirmation**: Not extracting budget from confirmations
3. **Calendar Auto-Trigger**: Not firing when all fields present
4. **Recursion Limits**: Some scenarios still hitting limits

## Files Modified

1. `/agents/salesAgent.js`:
   - extractLeadInfo tool (added conversation context)
   - System prompt (updated rules)
   - Recursion limit (increased to 50)

2. `/test-comprehensive-scenarios.js`:
